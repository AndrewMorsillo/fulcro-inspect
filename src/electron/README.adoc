= Electron Inspect

This directory contains the glue to make inspect work over a websocket connection.
The resulting infrastructure looks like this:

The inspect client is configured to use the websocket by
including the websocket preload instead of the local
chrome tools preload.  The Inspect UI will accept messages
from any source, so the IPC messages from the node server
just place them on the inspect message queue.

== General Usage (React Native)

Requires Fulcro 3.0.2 or above.

Your client will need to have `socket.io-client` in `package.json` (only tested
with shadow-cljs).

Then just add a preload for the websocket version of the inspect tool:

```
{...
 :builds {:app {:target           :react-native
                :init-fn          ...
                :devtools         {:autoload true
                                   :preloads [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.websocket-preload]}}}}
```

Then start the electron app, build your native app, and run it. It should connect.
