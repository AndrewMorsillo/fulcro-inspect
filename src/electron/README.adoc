= Electron Inspect

This directory contains the glue to make inspect work over a websocket connection.
The resulting infrastructure looks like this:

The inspect client is configured to use the websocket by
including the websocket preload instead of the local
chrome tools preload.  The Inspect UI will accept messages
from any source, so the IPC messages from the node server
just place them on the inspect message queue.
