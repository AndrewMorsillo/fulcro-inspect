Inspect Fulcro applications

## Usage

Add the latest version of this library (see above) as a dependency:

```
[fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect "x.x.x"]
```

Add a preload to your compiler options:

```clojure
:compiler {...
           :preloads        [fulcro.inspect.preload]
           ; ctrl-f is the default keystroke
           :external-config {:fulcro.inspect/config {:launch-keystroke "ctrl-f"}}}
```

The inspector will find the running Fulcro application, and be ready to inspect it!
